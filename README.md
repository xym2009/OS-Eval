# OSBenchMark

This repo contains a benchmark for optical and SAR image registration of the following manuscript, 'OSBenchmark: A Benchmark for High-resolution Optical and SAR Image Registration', which is submitted to ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing for possible publication.

The benchmark contains a high-resolution dataset for optical and SAR image registration and an improved registration algorithm. 

The dataset consists of 1232 optical and SAR image pairs and their corresponding ground truth, which is generated by natural corner reflectors that have clear and reliable structures both in optical and SAR images. The improved registration algorithm consists of four modules, geocoding, global matching, local matching and refinement. We made specific improvements in each module to increase the registration accuracy and reliability. Besides, we also provide the evaluation method and several state-of-the-art algorithms slightly modified to fit our dataset.

The download link of the dataset will be released in a few days.
